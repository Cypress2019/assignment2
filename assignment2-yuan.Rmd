```{r}
#Install the 'tidyverse' package or if that does not work, install the 'dplyr' and 'tidyr' packages.
#Load the package(s) you just installed
library(tidyr)
D1 <- read.csv("video-data.csv", header = TRUE)
#Create a data frame that only contains the years 2018
D2 <- filter(D1, year == 2018)
```

## Histograms
```{r}
#Generate a histogram of the watch time for the year 2018
hist(D2$watch.time)
#Change the number of breaks to 100, do you get the same impression?
hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100)
#Cut the y-axis off at 10
hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100, ylim = c(0,10))
#Restore the y-axis and change the breaks so that they are 0-5, 5-20, 20-25, 25-35
hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = c(0,5,20,25,35))
